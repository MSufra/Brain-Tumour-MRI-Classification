# Final-Project

My final project for the Monash University Data Bootcamp.

An app that can classify MRIs of the brain and predict whether a tumor is present and what kind of tumor.

It then stores the results in an SQL database for future reference

# Notebooks
Contains the jupyter notebook where the model is created.

# Resources
The images the model was trained on.

# Templates
Html templates the app runs.

# Static
Static files referenced by the templates.

# Note on deployment
As there were issues with deploying at the time of submission this app is still designed to run locally.
It currently refers to an SQL Database on my local machine and that reference will need to be changed if a user wishes to run the app on their machine.
